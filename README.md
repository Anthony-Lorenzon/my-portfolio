## Initial thoughts
I wanted a simple website with a relatively neutral color pallet. Everything was made responsive on screen size. things will adjust appropriately according to the size. I split the whole website into 4 sections.

### Section 1/Home
This section I wanted to keep with little text. It has my name and title. I thought it would be important to right away include links when clicking the LinkedIn Icon and GitHub Icon, there is also a button that will open a pdf of my resume. All links and icons opening to something new will open a new tab.

### Section 2/About me
I uncluded a small summary of my past experience and my transitioning career, included my skills (this section will likely change). When hovering over each icon it grows a little bigger.

### Section 3/Projects
I made "project cards" which include a picture, title, description and 2 links. This section will likely grow the more projects i do. For now the 2 links would link to the website however the 2 current projects don't have active websites. there is also a Github link on each card but those 2 current projects are private. When I expand this section I will add the link on an active website and same for the public githubs. There are small little effects that happen when hovering over each card and over each link icon.

### Section 4/Contant me
For this section i found this link https://web3forms.com/ When looking at other examples of websites they have a template version but they didn't work. I started to look into how hard it would be to implement. Then i found this service which makes it a lot easier. They give you the basic HTML code to implement it. I made changes by adding some labels and formating it nicely with css but it completely works. The service offers 250 free contacts per month which I would think is enough, at least for this stage.
